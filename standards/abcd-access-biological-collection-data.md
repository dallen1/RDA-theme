title: ABCD - Access to Biological Collection Data
name: abcd-access-biological-collection-data
description: <p>The <a href="http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115/">Access to Biological
  Collections Data (ABCD) Schema</a> is an evolving comprehensive standard for the
  access to and exchange of data about specimens and observations (a.k.a. primary
  biodiversity data). The ABCD Schema attempts to be comprehensive and highly structured,
  supporting data from a wide variety of databases. It is compatible with several
  existing data standards. Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised
  data and free-text can be accommodated.</p><p>Sponsored by Biodiversity Information
  Standards TDWG - the Taxonomic Databases Working Group, the current specification
  was last modified in 2007.</p>
