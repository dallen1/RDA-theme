title: MIBBI - Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations
name: mibbi-minimum-information-biological-and-biomedical-investigations
description: <p>A common portal to a group of nearly 40 checklists of Minimum Information
  for various biological disciplines. The MIBBI Foundry is developing a cross-analysis
  of these guidelines to create an intercompatible, extensible community of standards.</p><p>The
  concept was realized initially through the joint efforts of the Proteomics Standards
  Initiative, the Genomic Standards Consortium and the MGED RSBI Working Groups. The
  latest project to register with MIBBI is the MIABie guidelines for reporting biofilm
  research, as of January 2012.</p>
