description: <p>This encoding is an essential dependency for the OGC Sensor Observation
  Service (SOS) Interface Standard. More specifically, this standard defines XML schemas
  for observations, and for features involved in sampling when making observations.
  These provide document models for the exchange of information describing observation
  acts and their results, both within and between different scientific and technical
  communities.</p>
