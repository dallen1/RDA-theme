title: OME-XML - Open Microscopy Environment XML
name: ome-xml-open-microscopy-environment-xml
description: <p><a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/">OME-XML</a> is a
  vendor-neutral file format for biological image data, with an emphasis on metadata
  supporting light microscopy. It can be used as a data file format in its own right,
  or as a way of encoding metadata within a TIFF or BigTIFF file (for which purpose
  there is the <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/file-formats/ome-tiff/ome-tiff-specification">OME-TIFF</a>
  specification).</p><p>The standard is maintained by the Open Microscopy Environment
  Consortium, and was last updated in June 2012.</p>
